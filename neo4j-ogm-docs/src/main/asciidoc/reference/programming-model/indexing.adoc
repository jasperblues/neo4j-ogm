= Indexing

Indexing is used in Neo4j to quickly find nodes and relationships from which to start graph operations. 
Indexes are also employed to ensure uniqueness of elements with certain labels and properties.

[NOTE]
====
Please note that the lucene-based manual indexes are deprecated with Neo4j 2.0.
The default index is now based on labels and schema indexes and the related old APIs have been deprecated as well. 
The "legacy" index framework should only be used for fulltext and spatial indexes which are not currently supported via schema-based indexes.

== Index Management in Neo4j OGM

Index creation and management is outside the scope of this document.
Please see the Neo4j documention on indexes for for information:  http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/query-schema-index.html

== Index queries in Neo4jTemplate

Schema indexes are automatically used by Neo4j's Cypher engine, so using the annotated or derived repository finders or the query methods in `Neo4jTemplate` will use them out of the box.

== Neo4j auto indexes

Neo4j allows to configure (legacy) http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/auto-indexing.html[auto-indexing] for certain properties on nodes and relationships.
It is possible to use the specific index names `node_auto_index` and `relationship_auto_index` when querying indexes in Spring Data Neo4j either with the query methods in template and repositories or via Cypher.

== Full-text indexes

Previous versions of Spring Data Neo4j offered support for full-text queries using the manual index facilities.
However, as of SDN 4 milestone 1 at least, this is no longer supported.
To create fulltext entries for an entity you can add the updated nodes within `AfterSaveEvents` to a remote fulltext-index via Neo4j's REST API.
Fulltext query support is still available via Cypher queries and will be fully addressed by a future Neo4j version.

== Spatial indexes

Previous versions of Spring Data Neo4j offered support for spatial queries using the `neo4j-spatial` library.
However, as of SDN 4 milestone 1 at least, this is no longer supported.
To create spatial entries for an entity you can add the updated nodes within `AfterSaveEvents` to a remote fulltext-index via Neo4j's REST API.
Spatial query support is still available via Cypher queries and will be fully addressed by a future Neo4j version.
