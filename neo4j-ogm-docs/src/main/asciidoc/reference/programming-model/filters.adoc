= Filters

Filters provide a mechanism for customising the where clause of CYPHER generated by OGM. They can be chained
together with boolean operators, and associated with a comparison operator. Additionally, each filter contains a
`org.neo4j.ogm.cypher.function.FilterFunction`. A filter function can be provided when the filter is instantiated,
otherwise, by default a `org.neo4j.ogm.cypher.function.PropertyComparison` is used.


.Example of using a default property comparison Filter
In the example below, we're return a collection containing any satellited that is manned.
[source,java]
----
Collection<Satellite> satellites = session.loadAll(Satellite.class, new Filter("manned", true));
