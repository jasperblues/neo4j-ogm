= Transactions

Neo4j is a transactional database, only allowing operations to be performed within transaction boundaries.

Transactions can be managed explicitly by calling the `beginTransaction()` method on the `Session` followed by a `commit()` or `rollback()` as required.

.Transaction management
[source, java]
----
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
Person person = session.load(Person.class,personId);
Concert concert= session.load(Concert.class,concertId);
Hotel hotel = session.load(Hotel.class,hotelId);

try {
    buyConcertTicket(person,concert);
    bookHotel(person, hotel);
    tx.commit();
}
catch (SoldOutException e) {
    tx.rollback();
}
tx.close();
----


In the example above, the transaction is committed only when both a concert ticket and hotel room is available, otherwise, neither booking is made.

If you do not manage a transaction in this manner, auto commit transactions are provided implicitly for `Session` methods such as `save`, `load`, `delete`, `execute` and so on.
