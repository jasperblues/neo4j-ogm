Before we get to any code, we want to whiteboard our graph model.

Our College will contain Departments, each of which offer various subjects taught by a teacher.
Students enroll for courses or classes that teach a subject.

We're also going to model a Study Buddy which represents a group of students that get together to help one another study for a class.

Here's what we came up with.

In Java, this is straightforward:

[source, java]
----
public class Department {
    private String name;
    private Set<Subject> subjects;
}

public class Subject {
    private String name;
    private Department department;
    private Set<Teacher> teachers;
    private Set<Course> courses;
}

public class Teacher {
    private String name;
    private Set<Course> courses;
    private Set<Subject> subjects;
}

public class Course {
    private String name;
    private Subject subject;
    private Teacher teacher;
    private Set<Enrollment> enrollments;
}

public class Student {
    private String name;
    private Set<Enrollment> enrollments;
    private Set<StudyBuddy> studyBuddies;
}

public class Enrollment {
    private Student student;
    private Course course;
    private Date enrolledDate;
}
----

Note that when a student enrolls for a course, we're going to keep track of the enrollment date.
In the graph, this will be stored as a property on the ENROLLED relationship between a student and a course.
This kind of rich relationship is managed by the class `Enrollment` and is known as a relationship entity.
